fancontrol-hddtemp
==================

Simplistic script to control PWM output in relation to HDD/SSD temperatures.
Does not contain any more features (like settings fan to full speed on exit).
Needs lm_sensors and kernel with https://github.com/groeck/drivetemp (included
in upstream 5.6+)

For more advanced scripts, check:

* fancontrol script from https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors
